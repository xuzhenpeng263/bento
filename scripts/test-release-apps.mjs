// WHAT THIS PROVES. `scripts/apps.mjs` tells the release pipeline what to
// build, what the built file is called, and which app id to sign the manifest
// with. None of it can be checked by running a release: a release SIGNS, and
// the signing key never leaves the maintainer's machine (docs/RELEASING.md),
// so the pipeline is deliberately not CI-testable.
//
// The registry drifting from the tree is, and each field fails differently:
//
//   · `dir` wrong        → the release cannot find package.json. Loud, harmless.
//   · `shell` wrong      → the build succeeds and staging copies a file that is
//                          not there. Discovered mid-release.
//   · `changelog` wrong  → also silent, and it ships. The notes ride in the
//                          SIGNED manifest and are rendered inline by every
//                          file that finds an update, so an app pointed at
//                          another app's changelog tells all of its users about
//                          a product they do not have. (Every app read the root
//                          CHANGELOG until 2026-08-03.)
//   · `appId` wrong      → the WORST case, and silent. A shipped shell verifies
//                          the manifest's `app` against its own configureApp()
//                          id (kernel/src/update.ts), so a mismatch signs and
//                          publishes an update channel every file quietly
//                          declines. Nothing errors; updates simply stop.
//
// So the registry is pinned against the app's own source of truth: its
// package.json build script, and the configureApp() call in its main.ts.
