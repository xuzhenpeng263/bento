# Parallel work — discipline for many agents, many tools

Bento development runs many parallel agents (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity,
…) across multiple apps. These tools share **nothing but this repository** —
no memory, no chat context. So the repo is the coordination surface, and these
rules exist to keep N parallel workstreams from dissolving into merge hell.
(Empirically: 11 parallel PRs once produced cascading conflicts on `render.ts`,
`i18n/*`, and `CHANGELOG.md` — every rule here traces back to that.)

## 1. Ownership zones

- **App zones** — `slides/` (shipped) and `spaces/` (scaffold); `dash/` when
  it lands. Parallel work is safe *within different apps*. Agents working on
  different apps must not touch each other's app directories. Each app owns
  its own `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/model.ts` and
  `src/i18n.ts` facade.
- **Kernel zone — `kernel/src/`** — `save.ts` (splice + webdeck/enc),
  `autosave.ts`, `update.ts`, `anim.ts`, `charts.ts`, the `i18n.ts` engine,
  `app.ts`, `doc.ts`; plus `slides/src/sync/` and `server/`, which are shared
  in effect even though they still live app-side. See `docs/PLATFORM.md` §9.
  This zone is:
  **serialize, don't parallelize.** One coordinated change at a time, reviewed
  against the platform invariants. If your app task needs a kernel change,
  stop, make (or request) the kernel change as its own small PR, land it,
  then continue.
- **Ops zone** — `server/`, `scripts/`, `site-src/`: maintainer-coordinated;
  relay changes have deploy-order constraints (`docs/PLATFORM.md` §5).

## 2. Branch & PR discipline

- One branch = one agent = one concern. Never share a branch between agents
  or tools.
- Small, single-purpose PRs. A PR that "also fixes" something unrelated will
  conflict with the agent that was assigned that something.
- **Integrate frequently.** Long-lived branches are where conflicts breed;
  rebase/merge from `main` at least daily while a branch is open.
- `main` is branch-protected (1 review, no force-push). Merge order for a
  batch: independent zones first, then known-overlapping PRs one at a time,
  re-checking mergeability between each.
- Every PR body states: what changed, how it was verified (commands run,
  browser-tested or not), and any platform invariant it touches.

## 3. Known conflict magnets (pre-empt them)

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — every feature branch appends to `[Unreleased]`. Keep
  entries as one self-contained block; when apps multiply, each app gets its
  own changelog (`slides/CHANGELOG.md`, …).
- **i18n catalogs** — append-only additions at the TOP of each catalog map;
  never reorder or reformat existing entries. All 7 catalogs in the same PR
  as the source string.
- **`render.ts` / shared modules** — additive features must COMPOSE (blur +
  blend + backdrop all coexist; gradient + stroke coexist). When resolving a
  conflict between two features, the answer is almost always "keep both".
- **Version/release files** (`package.json` version, manifests) — maintainer
  only, at release time.

## 4. Tool assignment

Assign tools per app, not per file: mixing three tools' edits inside one
module means reconciling three styles and three context gaps. A reasonable
split is one tool as the primary for each app + one doing cross-cutting
review. Whatever the split, record it in `docs/DECISIONS.md` so every session
of every tool can see it.

## 5. Verification bar (before any PR is opened)

- `node_modules/.bin/tsc -b` clean in the affected app
- `npm run build:single` succeeds (the single-file build IS the product)
- `node scripts/test-sync.ts` if anything under `sync/` changed
- user-visible changes exercised in a real browser (dev server), not assumed
- i18n: new strings present in all catalogs (`x-pseudo` audit catches strays)
- no edits under generated dirs (`site/`, `dist-single/`)

## 6. Picking up work without colliding

Zones stop *cross-app* collisions. Two agents inside one app will still
collide, and no tooling fixes that — it is a work-assignment question.
Practical rules for a small team running many agents:

- **One agent per app zone at a time**, unless the maintainer has explicitly
  split the work by file.
- **Push the branch early**, before the work is finished, so another agent can
  see it exists.
- **Check `gh pr list` before starting.** An open PR touching your files is
  the cheapest collision warning available.
- **Branches whose commits look unmerged may already be shipped.** `main` was
  rewritten once (to scrub a bot's commits), which orphaned older branch
  hashes. Compare *content*, not commit ids, before "rescuing" anything.
- Agents from other harnesses (Codex, Antigravity) read `AGENTS.md`, not this
  file — keep the hard rules mirrored there.

## 7. Coordination artifacts (the shared brain)

- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — append-only decision log. Before starting non-trivial
  work: read it. After settling anything another agent could contradict:
  append to it (date, decision, why, owner). Decisions live here, not in any
  one tool's chat history.
- `docs/PLATFORM.md` — the invariants; change only with maintainer sign-off.
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — behavioral contract + deep architecture.
- Work assignment lives with the maintainer (issues/task list); an agent that
  finds adjacent-but-out-of-scope work files it as a note or issue instead of
  expanding its own PR.

## 8. What agents never do

- Release, publish, deploy, or touch signing keys (maintainer-only, local).
- Rewrite history or force-push shared branches.
- Merge external contributors' PRs without provenance review.
- "Fix" another in-flight branch's code from their own branch.
- Add AI co-author trailers or bot identities to commits.
