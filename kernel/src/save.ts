// --- static first-page preview (file-manager thumbnails) ---------------------
//
// THE PROBLEM. A Bento file is one HTML document, and thumbnailers — iOS
// Files, macOS QuickLook/Finder, the Bento Tray app — render HTML with
// JavaScript DISABLED (verified: `qlmanage -t` renders <noscript> content).
// Until our runtime boots, every deck genuinely IS the same bytes plus the
// boot splash, so every deck thumbnailed as the same dark box.
//
// THE FIX. At save time we write a STATIC rendering of page one into the file
// and park it inside a `<noscript>`. That element's contents are rendered only
// when scripting is off, which is exactly the population we are addressing:
// a real reader never sees it — not for a frame — so there is no flash to
// suppress, no interaction with the splash's `.done`/`bsAuto` dismissal, and
// nothing for print or present to exclude. When a thumbnailer runs scripts
// after all, the preview is simply never rendered and we are back to today's
// behaviour: a regression is not possible, only an improvement.
//
// It is shell FURNITURE, not document data: nothing here enters `#bento-doc`,
// no format field is added, and a file saved by an older build (which has no
// preview) opens identically.
//
// The kernel knows nothing about how any app draws a page. It owns the
// placement, the replace-don't-append rule, the encryption veto and the
// output-safety check; the app hands back a ready-made element.
