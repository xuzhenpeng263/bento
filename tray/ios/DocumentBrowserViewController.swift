    /// 1. `didImportDocumentAt` IS NEVER CALLED for the creation flow. The
    ///    creation handler fires and the file lands correctly, but the delegate
    ///    callback never arrives — so the editor never opened and "+" appeared
    ///    to do nothing while silently creating files. Placing the file means we
    ///    hold the URL and can open it directly, depending on no callback.
    /// 2. Naming collisions become ours to control. Letting the system rename
    ///    produced "Untitled.bento 2.html", because it reads `.webdeck.html` as
    ///    the name "Untitled.bento" plus extension "html" and inserts the
    ///    counter before the last extension only. Ours reads "Untitled 2".
