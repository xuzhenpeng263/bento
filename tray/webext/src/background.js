//
// MEASURED (docs/DECISIONS.md, 2026-08-02): one `showDirectoryPicker` grant
// survives IndexedDB and a reload — still `granted` with no gesture, and
// re-grantable with one click when it lapses — and covers files INSIDE the
// folder that were never picked. That is what lets a deck opened by
// double-clicking be written without a destination prompt, which no web page
// can do for itself.
//
// TWO RULES SHAPE THIS FILE.
//
// 1. NO STATE BETWEEN MESSAGES. An MV3 service worker is evicted whenever the
//    browser feels like it, and a save serialises the whole deck first —
//    encryption, preview, ~900KB — so an eviction can easily land between
//    "which file is this?" and "write it". Anything held in memory across that
//    gap produces a failed save that looks random and reproduces on nobody's
//    machine. So every message re-resolves from the grant; nothing is cached.
//
// 2. THE PAGE DOES NOT GET TO SAY WHICH FILE IT IS. `sender.url` is set by the
//    browser, not by the content script, so it cannot be forged by the document
//    — whereas anything in the message payload can. A local HTML file is
//    untrusted content; if it could name its own target it could name somebody
//    else's deck in the granted folder and overwrite it. The path comes from
//    the sender, and a payload path is ignored even if present.
