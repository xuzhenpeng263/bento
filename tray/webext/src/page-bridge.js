// The page-world half of the bridge. Runs in the DOCUMENT's world (MAIN), at
// document_start, so it is in place before the deck's own runtime boots.
//
// WHAT IT OVERRIDES AND WHY. `kernel/src/save.ts` tests exactly one thing —
// `typeof window.showSaveFilePicker === 'function'` — and needs only:
//
//     showSaveFilePicker({suggestedName}) -> { name, createWritable() }
//     createWritable() -> { write(Blob|string), close() }
//
// That is tray's contract (tray/README.md), and it is why no web-side change is
// needed: every in-place path (⌘S, autosave write-back, self-update) already
// routes through that function, including in decks whose embedded runtime
// predates this extension.
//
// The wrinkle unique to a browser host: on `file://` in Chrome that function
// ALREADY EXISTS. So unlike tray on iOS, where the polyfill fills a gap, here it
// REPLACES a working API that prompts for a destination. The override therefore
// has to be conservative — see `wantsOpenFile` below. Anything it does not
// recognise falls through to the native picker, which still works exactly as it
// did.

   * When it differs — "Save a copy…", a template, a read-only export, an invite
   * — they mean a NEW file somewhere they choose, and taking that over silently
   * would write to a place nobody asked for. Those go to the native picker.

  /**
   * Is this save meant to overwrite the document on screen?
   *
   * `id` is the answer, and it is the ONLY reliable one. It was added to
   * `save.ts` for exactly this (#213, `pickerIdFor`): before it, ⌘S and "Save a
   * copy…" reached the picker with byte-identical arguments, this code guessed
   * in-place, and it overwrote the open deck — no dialog, no new file.
   *
   *   bento-doc    ⌘S, or a first save of an unsaved document → write in place
   *   bento-copy   "Save a copy…"                             → the author chooses
   *   bento-share  view-only, package, invite, template       → the author chooses
   *
   * Default to declining. An unknown or absent id means a caller we have not
   * seen; the native picker is the correct answer.
   *
   * And the id alone is not enough: a deck whose runtime PREDATES #213 sends
   * `bento-doc` for every save, "Save a copy…" included, so acting on it there
   * reproduces exactly the bug this replaced. Hence the runtime-version gate —
   * old decks keep the behaviour they have today, which is correct and safe.
   * The failure directions are not symmetric: declining costs a prompt, taking
   * over wrongly costs the file.
