# Changelog

All notable changes to **bento/spaces**. The app version is baked into every
shell as `APP_VERSION` (from `spaces/package.json`) and shown in the About
dialog; a shipped file updates itself through the signed release channel.

This file is per-app on purpose. The notes ride inside the **signed** update
manifest and are what someone reads while deciding whether to rewrite their
file — so an app must never describe another app's changes.

The format (`bento/spaces`, version `1`) is additive and stable — every version
below opens files from every earlier version, and unknown fields are preserved.
Versions follow `0.MINOR.PATCH` while pre-1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-03

First release.

- **A space is one file: a tree of pages, in HTML you can mail.** Pages nest,
  the sidebar is the tree, and everything — text, images, structure, the editor
  itself — is in the single file you saved. No account, no server, no folder of
  attachments that goes missing when you forward it.

- **Writing that gets out of the way.** Markdown as you type — `# `, `- `,
  `1. `, `> `, `[] ` and `**bold**` each become the thing they describe — a `/`
  menu at the caret for every block type, a grip to drag blocks and pages into
  a new order, and `[[` to link a page by name, which offers to create that
  page if it does not exist yet.

- **Links go both ways.** Link to a page and that page lists who linked to it.
  Nothing to maintain: backlinks are derived, so a space stays navigable
  without anyone curating an index.

- **Find anything, and change it everywhere.** ⌘K jumps to any page or block
  by content; ⌘F finds and replaces across the whole space, not just the page
  you are looking at.

- **Images that do not make the file unmailable.** A phone photo is downscaled
  to fit the column before it is embedded, and the space says so — with the
  original one click away. Identical images are stored once. Measured: a 4.9 MB
  photograph embeds as 33 KB.

- **Reading view.** Hide the editing surface and read — or hand the file to
  someone else, who sees the same thing. Printing and PDF export follow the
  same rules: toggles print open, archived pages are excluded.

- **Nine languages.** English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano,
  Português, 日本語, 中文 (简体 / 繁體). The interface follows the reader, not
  the document, so one file reads in each person's own language.

- **Archive rather than delete.** An archived page leaves the sidebar and the
  search results but stays in the file, restorable, because the file is the
  only copy there is.

- **A space does not phone home when you open it.** If a document references
  an image on the web, it is not fetched until you ask — the placeholder names
  the site first. Opening a file someone mailed you should not tell a third
  party that you read it, and nothing else in a space touches the network.

- **Password protection, autosave and recovery, signed self-update** —
  the platform guarantees, on the same terms as bento/slides.
