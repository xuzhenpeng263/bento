# Third-party notices

webdeck is MIT-licensed (© 2026 The WebDeck authors; see `LICENSE`).
The shippable single-file shell (`WebDeck.webdeck.html`) bundles the
following third-party open-source components. Their license terms require that
these notices accompany copies, so the same text is embedded as a `NOTICE`
comment near the top of every built shell and every saved WebDeck document.

Full MIT license text is reproduced in the shell's `NOTICE` comment and in the
`LICENSE` file. The SIL Open Font License 1.1 text is available at
https://openfontlicense.org.

Dev-only tooling (Vite, TypeScript, `vite-plugin-singlefile`, `qrcode`,
`@types/*`) is used to build WebDeck but is **not** bundled into the shipped shell
and is therefore not listed here.
